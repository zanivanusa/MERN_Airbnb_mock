# MERN_AirBnb_like_app
 post and book listings to stay at. 
 For the app to work i would have to add your ip in my mongoDB cluster so you can connect to it, therefore this is just a showcase of my work, but feel free to create your own cluster and update the code.
 
I did not focus too much on the design but mainly on the functionalities.

Our profile page shows us the listings that we created and those that we have booked ourselves.

if the listing gets booked, it is no longer shown in the avalible listings on the main page

In the code there are many potential functionalities that i did not implement due to time constraits, for instance the functionality to add and count how liked a listing is...
